# Competitive Research Skill for Claude Code

A weekly competitive analysis workflow that auto-discovers your product from
its codebase, researches competitors on the web, and produces a ranked,
evidence-backed list of features you're missing — scored with PM frameworks
(Jobs-to-be-Done, Kano, RICE) and deduped against prior weeks.

Zero-config: drop the skill in, run it from your repo, get a report. No
filling out forms.

---

## What you get

Every run produces a `report.md` with:

1. **Executive summary** — the 3–5 most important findings
2. **Product dossier** — what the skill inferred about your product (so you can correct it if wrong)
3. **Landscape snapshot** — how the competitive set has shifted since last run
4. **Feature matrix** — a ✅/❌/🟡 table across you and 8–15 competitors
5. **Top 10 feature recommendations** — each with RICE scoring, evidence quotes from real users, and specific files/modules in *your* codebase where the work would land
6. **"Don't build" list** — features competitors have that you should deliberately skip
7. **Non-feature observations** — pricing, positioning, and messaging shifts
8. **Sources** — every claim traceable to a URL

State persists across runs in `./competitive-research/`, so each week dedupes against the last and surfaces what's genuinely new.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed and working — see [the official installation guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) if you don't have it yet
- **Python 3.7+** for the dedupe script (almost certainly already installed)
- **`gh` CLI** (optional but recommended) for richer git/issue/PR signals — [install instructions](https://cli.github.com/)
- **`tokei` or `cloc`** (optional) for repo size metrics

---

## Installation

This is a **Claude Code plugin**. Install it via the marketplace flow or directly from a local clone.

### Option A — Install from this GitHub repo (recommended)

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add dharrisHub/Competitive-Research-Skill
/plugin install competitive-research@Competitive-Research-Skill
```

The first command registers this repo as a marketplace; the second installs the plugin from it. Claude Code resolves the plugin name (`competitive-research`) from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

### Option B — Local development install

If you cloned this repo and want to test or hack on it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dharrisHub/Competitive-Research-Skill.git
cd Competitive-Research-Skill
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add ./
/plugin install competitive-research@Competitive-Research-Skill
```

Edits to `skills/competitive-research/SKILL.md` and the references take effect on the next skill invocation — no reinstall needed.

### Verify the plugin loaded

```
/plugin
```

You should see `competitive-research` in the installed plugins list. The skill itself will be discoverable as `/competitive-research:competitive-research` (plugin name + skill name) or invokable by natural-language trigger inside any project.

---

## Usage

### First run

1. `cd` into your product's repo (or a monorepo subdirectory if scope C).
2. Open Claude Code.
3. Say something like:

   > Run the competitive research

   Or any of these — the skill is set to trigger broadly:
   - "What features are competitors shipping that we're not?"
   - "Do a gap analysis on my product"
   - "What should I build next quarter?"
   - "Run the weekly competitive review"

The first run takes the longest (typically 10–20 minutes of work) because it's discovering everything from scratch — your product identity, your features, your competitors. Subsequent runs are faster because state persists.

### Weekly cadence

The skill is designed to run weekly. Each run:

- Re-discovers your codebase (catches new features you've shipped)
- Re-checks competitor changelogs and websites
- Tags recommendations as `[NEW]`, `[RECURRING]`, or `[REVISITED]` based on prior runs
- Saves a fresh report under `./competitive-research/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/`

You can run it manually each Monday morning, or automate it. A simple cron job:

```bash
# Run every Monday at 9am, write output to a log file
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/your/repo && claude -p "run the competitive research" > ~/competitive-research-$(date +%Y%m%d).log 2>&1
```

(Adjust the `claude -p` invocation to match your Claude Code version and shell. The point is: it's a regular CLI command, schedule it however you like.)

### What gets created in your repo

After the first run, you'll find:

```
your-repo/
└── competitive-research/                    # all skill output, gitignored by default
    ├── runs/
    │   └── 2026-04-24/
    │       ├── product-dossier.md           # what the skill thinks your product is
    │       ├── raw-notes/                   # one file per competitor, full notes
    │       ├── evidence.md                  # quotes, screenshots, pricing snapshots
    │       └── report.md                    # ← the deliverable
    ├── history/
    │   └── seen-features.jsonl              # dedupe log, append-only
    ├── competitors.yaml                     # persistent competitor list
    └── overrides.yaml                       # optional, only if you want to override discovery
```

You probably want to add `competitive-research/` to your `.gitignore` unless you specifically want this committed.

---

## Optional: overriding auto-discovery

If a run got something wrong about your product (e.g., it inferred the wrong target user), create `./competitive-research/overrides.yaml`:

```yaml
# Anything blank gets auto-discovered. Only fill in what's wrong.
product_name_override: ""
product_url_override: ""
target_user_override: "solo founders running Shopify stores doing $10k–$100k/mo"
extra_known_competitors:
  - "Klaviyo — https://klaviyo.com"
  - "Postscript — https://postscript.io"
strategic_constraints_override: |
  - We're a 2-person team, no enterprise features
  - AI features are a Q2 priority
monorepo_scope: ""
```

The skill checks for this file every run. The end of each report flags inferences that the user might want to override, so you only fill in fields that the skill got wrong.

---

## Customization

The plugin is just files. Fork the repo (or clone it for local install per Option B above) and edit:

- **`skills/competitive-research/SKILL.md`** — change the workflow itself (e.g., add a phase, change the report format)
- **`skills/competitive-research/references/frameworks.md`** — adjust which PM frameworks get applied or how they're scored
- **`skills/competitive-research/references/codebase-discovery.md`** — add signals specific to your stack (e.g., "also check our `feature-flags.json`")
- **`skills/competitive-research/references/report-template.md`** — change the report structure
- **`skills/competitive-research/scripts/dedupe_features.py`** — tune the similarity thresholds for the dedupe pass
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — bump `version` when you publish a change

If you customize, keep `SKILL.md` under ~500 lines — Claude Code uses progressive disclosure, where SKILL.md is always loaded but reference files only get read when the workflow points to them. Pushing detail into references keeps the skill efficient.

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin doesn't show up in `/plugin` list:**
- Make sure you ran both commands — `marketplace add` registers the source, `install` adds the plugin from it.
- Restart Claude Code if the marketplace was just added.
- Check `~/.claude/plugins/` for the install. If the marketplace add succeeded but install failed, look for errors in the Claude Code log.

**Skill triggers but immediately produces a generic answer:**
- Claude Code answered without consulting the skill body. Try a more specific phrase like "use the competitive-research skill to..." or invoke it explicitly with `/competitive-research:competitive-research`.
- Skills undertrigger on simple-sounding requests. Phrasing the ask as multi-step ("do a full competitive analysis and gap report") helps.

**Phase 0 produces a wrong product description:**
- Open the latest `runs/YYYY-MM-DD/product-dossier.md` to see exactly what was inferred and from which sources.
- Set the relevant override in `./competitive-research/overrides.yaml` and rerun.

**Web research is shallow / few competitors found:**
- This usually means the product category was hard to identify from the codebase alone. Set `extra_known_competitors` in `overrides.yaml` to seed the search with 2–3 competitors you know about.

**Recommendations feel obvious / repetitive across weeks:**
- Check `history/seen-features.jsonl` — make sure entries from prior runs are actually being saved. The dedupe step relies on this file.
- The skill enforces "at least 2 non-obvious recommendations per report" as a quality check. If you're consistently getting obvious ones, the issue is usually that the inferred strategic constraints are too vague — add specific constraints via override.

**Dedupe script errors:**
- Run it manually to see the actual error. Find the install path with `ls ~/.claude/plugins/` and run:
  ```bash
  python ~/.claude/plugins/<install-dir>/skills/competitive-research/scripts/dedupe_features.py \
    --new shortlist.json \
    --history ./competitive-research/history/seen-features.jsonl
  ```
- Common cause: malformed JSONL line in the history file. Open it and remove the bad line.

## How it works (under the hood)

The plugin wraps a single skill that uses Claude Code's progressive disclosure pattern:

- **`skills/competitive-research/SKILL.md`** is loaded into context whenever the skill is triggered. It's a workflow skeleton with pointers.
- **`skills/competitive-research/references/*.md`** are loaded only when the workflow needs them — frameworks for scoring, the report template for writing, the codebase-discovery guide for Phase 0.
- **`skills/competitive-research/scripts/dedupe_features.py`** runs as a subprocess (via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`) for the deterministic similarity-matching step. It surfaces likely matches; Claude makes the final semantic call.

This keeps the always-on context small (SKILL.md is ~170 lines) while making the deeper detail available when needed.

## Uninstalling

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin uninstall competitive-research
/plugin marketplace remove Competitive-Research-Skill
```

The plugin's runtime output (`./competitive-research/` in your project repos) is separate and is not removed by uninstalling. Delete it manually if you want.

---

## License & feedback

Use it however you want. If a phase consistently produces bad output, the most useful thing is to capture a real example (the prompt + the output you got + what you wanted) and edit the relevant `references/*.md` file directly. Skills are designed to be edited.
